# Real-time testing

**Rule:** Code is not written in bulk and tested at the end. Every meaningful edit is followed by the **narrowest command that proves the edit**, before the next edit.

This skill **tests itself in real time** — you run commands, read output, fix, re-run. No "should pass" without evidence.

## The loop (mandatory)

```
1. Define the next smallest behavior (from deliverable-first checklist)
2. RED   — run a check; capture failing output (or type error)
3. GREEN — minimal change; re-run until pass
4. REFACTOR — clean-minimal-code; re-run same command
5. Repeat until acceptance checklist complete
```

**Never skip step 2.** If you cannot fail the check, the check is too weak.

## Pick the narrowest proof

| Change type | First command to run |
|---|---|
| Pure function / domain rule | Unit test for that function, or `node -e` / `python -c` one-liner |
| API route / handler | Single request test (supertest, httpx, fetch to local dev) |
| React component logic | Component test or Storybook interaction test |
| Type-only change | `tsc --noEmit` or `pnpm typecheck` |
| Lint/format | `eslint` / `ruff check` on touched files |
| DB migration | Migrate up on local DB + one integration test |
| Full slice uncertain | Smallest test file covering the slice, not whole suite |

Escalate to full suite or E2E only after slice tests are green.

## Watch mode (preferred when available)

Keep a watcher running in a **tmux** terminal while editing:

| Stack | Watch command |
|---|---|
| Vitest | `pnpm vitest --watch related` or `--changed` |
| Jest | `pnpm jest --watch --findRelatedTests path/to/file.test.ts` |
| pytest | `pytest --lf -x` (last failed) or `ptw` (pytest-watch) |
| TypeScript | `tsc --noEmit --watch` in parallel |
| Go | `go test ./... -count=1` after saves, or `air` for apps |

If watch is unavailable, run the related test file manually after **each** save batch.

## After every slice (minimum bar)

Before moving to the next file or feature area:

1. **Related tests** — pass (show exit code 0 or summary line)
2. **Typecheck** — if TS project, no new errors in touched packages
3. **Lint** — on changed files if the repo uses it

Store evidence: last command + relevant output lines in your working notes. `proactive-agency` requires this before claiming done.

## TDD micro-rules

- One behavior assertion per test when learning a module; merge later if noisy.
- Test **behavior**, not implementation (avoid asserting private method calls).
- Fixtures: smallest factory that satisfies the type; no 200-line JSON blobs.
- Flaky test = broken product — fix or quarantine immediately, never ignore.

## When no tests exist

1. Read `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `Makefile` for the canonical test script.
2. Add **one** test file next to the code you change (match repo convention).
3. If repo truly has zero test infra, run the **next best proof**: script invocation, curl, or typecheck — and note the gap.

Do not use missing tests as an excuse to skip the loop.

## Integration with other skills

| Phase | Skill |
|---|---|
| Define what to prove | `deliverable-first` (acceptance checklist) |
| Structure test doubles | `stable-architecture` (ports/adapters) |
| Browser proof of full story | `verification` (after unit/integration green) |
| PR CI red | `fix-ci` / `loop-on-ci` |

## Anti-patterns

| Do not | Do instead |
|---|---|
| "Tests pass" without running them | Paste command + exit code |
| Run full E2E for every line change | Related unit/integration first |
| Commit with `@ts-ignore` to go green | Fix types or narrow the boundary |
| Disable a test to go green | Fix product or test |
| Batch 10 files then test once | Slice + loop per checkbox |

## Done definition

A task is **done** when:

- Every acceptance checkbox from `deliverable-first` has a **fresh** passing check
- The same checks would pass on CI (same scripts, no local-only env hacks)
- You can name the exact commands to reproduce green state
